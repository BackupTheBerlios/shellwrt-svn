Nedi via SVN

NeDi 1.0.w	(C) 2001 - 2006 Remo Rickli (http://nedi.sourceforge.net)
==============

Introduction
------------
NeDi is a lightwheight network management suite, which is based on a scheduled discovery, a SQL backend and a web based user interface. It can discover a mixed corperate network dynamically and manage stock, used devices, configurations (IOS, CatOS, Cisco1900 and limited support for HP Procurve and Ironware), monitoring and network clients. As it gets more and more sophisticated, I recommend using HTTPS only and limit the range of IP addresses allowed to access NeDi.

Quick Setup
-----------
on a Ubuntu system, run contrib/install.sh (thanks Tristan)

Manual Setup
------------
1) Required software (may work with older versions, but this is what I use now):
- Perl 5.8.5	(modules: Net::SNMP, Net::Telnet::Cisco,Algorithm::Diff and DBD::mysql an Net::SSH::Perl, if you need ssh)
- PHP 4.3.9	(modules: SNMP,MYSQL,GD for the webinterface) 
- Optional support for resolving arp (if you don't have a router to retrieve the arp cache) requires arpwatch
- Optional rrd support to graph interface traffic requires rrdtool


2) Extract the NeDi archive (e.g. to /opt/nedi). You'll need to add a link in your webserver documents to nedi's frontend (e.g. ln -s /opt/nedi/html /var/www/nedi) and to the rrd files (e.g. ln -s /opt/nedi/rrd /var/www/nedi/inc/rrd)


3) Edit nedi.conf to fit your needs and link it to /etc.


4) do a nedi.pl -i to initialize the backend. I recommend to dump users and monitoring if your upgrading from an older version:
mysqldump nedi monitoring user -u nedi -p > nedi-mon-usr.sql
and put them back in after recreating the database:
cat nedi-mon-usr.sql |mysql -u nedi -p nedi


5) Scan a few devices (define borders when using -c). Check the results and make sure you don't get any weird errors. Use -v for verbose output or just -d to get some debug info. Use -o, if you dare to find non-Cisco devices (refer to ouidev in nedi.conf). 

More words on .def files: Since 1.0.u the devices can be defined with definition files residing in the sysobj directory.Do a ./nedi.pl -cd (basic CDP with debugging enabled). NeDi shows the sysobjID of a device and if a .def file for that OID exists, it can determine the device type (and other information you specify in that particular file).

192.168.1.31    Twhga102         1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.278=Cat3548    0/0/1            m68      70/147

I assume you see where this is going. If you get something like this:

192.168.38.5   PotlaU03         1.3.6.1.4.1.800.3.1.1.3=other InIl   a1 o0  m59           2/252

You'll need to create a new definition file, with the appropriate OIDs and specs for that device. Click on the OID in Devices-List and work with the new Defgen tool. An existing .def file in the html/log directory will be read this way. You'll find additional definitions in the contrib directory as well. Email your new definitions to remo.rickli(AT)psi.ch, if you want them to be included, but make sure they're as accurate as possible!


6) If all went well, try to discover your entire network. Please note how long it took. Then think about how often you want to scan your entire network. We have about 260 devices connecting 4500 nodes to each other, which takes about 30 minutes to discover. We run it every 4h. Therefore our rrdstep is 14400 and the cronjob looks like this:
7 0 * * *    cd /opt/nedi;./nedi.pl -cob
7 4,8,12,16,20 * * * cd /opt/nedi;./nedi.pl -co

This will scan the network every 4h and backup configurations each night at 7mins past midnight. Unless you have a very big network (e.g. > 500 devices) this should be fine. Smaller networks can be scanned more often. Parallelizing would greatly improve this, but NeDi is a quiet tool for now...


7) Login to the web front end with admin pw:admin
================================================================================

According to Damien Hauser, it should work on Windows as well:
"Just do a ppm install of the missing perl module (if you have activestate perl).

eg:
- ppm install net::telnet::cisco
- ppm install dbi
etc..."

FAQ
---

1) Where's nedimap.php?
This PHP script is generated on the fly. If you don't see after using the map feature, check the file permissions on your web server.

2) I get errors retrieving the ports on Cat3500XL or Cat29x0 using IOS Version 12.0(5), what's wrong?
There seems to be a bug with the bridge mib in this version. Try upgrading the IOS.

oxo: the dot1 mibs need a sleep time: so after each access wait 9 sec and then you can ask again

3) How about uniqueness of MAC addresses and vlans?
Due to the fact that NeDi now supports different vendors, it's quite impossible to assign vlans to MAC addresses and vtp domains to vlans. Therefore MAC addresses are always unique and Vlans won't be bound to VTP domains.

4) My PHP doesn't generate images or is not capable of doing SNMP queries?
Make sure you have GD and Net-SNMP installed. PHP should then be compiled with:
./configure --with-gd --with-snmp  --with-mysql --with-apxs2 --prefix=/usr --with-zlib
make
make install

5) I don't see interface in octets on Cat2950 running 12.1(6)EA2a with snmp v2c, what's wrong?
It seems the switch doesn't like perl Net:SNMP. Upgrade the switch...

6) I get the name instead of the serial# on a AP1200 running IOS, surely this is a NeDi bug?
No not exactly, did you enter the name on the snmp settings page? Try deleting it from there and see what happens...

7) I get a white screen after login in, why?
Install MYSQL and Session for PHP.
